  "Personal Description" : "I'm a very introverted and quiet person who enjoys solitude and a peaceful environment. I value my personal space and am most comfortable when I can relax in my room with a good book, music, or simply thinking. I prefer minimal interaction with others and find social gatherings overwhelming. I like a tidy, organized home but don’t often engage with people. My hobbies include reading, writing, hiking, and spending time in nature. I’m generally a night owl and enjoy staying up late. I appreciate roommates who respect privacy and maintain a calm, quiet atmosphere.",
